Smockito is a tiny framework-agnostic Scala 3 facade for
<a href="https://github.com/mockito/mockito">Mockito</a>. It enables setting up
unique method and value stubs for any type in a type-safe manner, while
providing an expressive interface for inspecting received arguments and call
counts.

<br clear="right" />

Smockito leverages a subset of Mockito’s features and offers a minimal,
opinionated interface, guided by a few core principles described in the
<a href="motivation.html">Motivation</a>. Head to the
<a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> section to learn how to use
Smockito in your Scala 3 projects and dive into the
<a href="guide.html">Guide</a> page for a detailed overview of its capabilities.
