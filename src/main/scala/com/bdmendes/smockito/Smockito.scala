  *
  * All methods on [[Mock]] require an
  * [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/fun-eta-expansion.html eta-expanded method]] as the
  * first argument. The [[it]] shorthand is a terse way of capturing the mocked type in context.
  *
  * Method stubs are set up with [[on]]. Besides the method to mock, it requires a
  * [[PartialFunction]] to handle the expected inputs, represented as a well-typed tuple, with the
  * same shape as the mocked method arguments, that one may destructure.
  *
  * [[calls]] provides the captured arguments of all the past invocations of a stubbed method, in
  * chronological order, in the form of a tuple with the same shape as the method arguments, Ã  la
  * `scalamock`. If one only cares about the number of times a stub was called, [[times]] is more
  * efficient.
  *
  * [[Mock]] is interoperable with all [[org.mockito.Mockito]] APIs.
