  *
  * All methods on [[Mock]] require an
  * [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/fun-eta-expansion.html eta-expanded method]] as the
  * first argument. The [[it]] shorthand is a terse way of capturing the mocked type in context.
  *
  * Method stubs are set up with [[on]]. Besides the method to mock, it requires a
  * [[PartialFunction]] to handle the expected inputs, well-typed with the same shape as the mocked
  * method arguments, that one may destructure. If you want to operate on the call number instead of
  * the received arguments, use [[onCall]].
  *
  * For spying on a real instance, use [[forward]]. For dispatching to a real implementation, use
  * [[real]].
  *
  * [[calls]] provides the captured arguments of all the past invocations of a stubbed method, in
  * chronological order, packed with the same shape as the method arguments, Ã  la `scalamock`. If
  * one only cares about the number of times a stub was called, [[times]] is more efficient. At
  * last, [[calledBefore]] allows reasoning about interaction orders.
