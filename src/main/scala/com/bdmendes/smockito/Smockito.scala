/** [[https://github.com/bdmendes/smockito Smockito]] is a tiny framework-agnostic facade for
  * `Mockito`.

  *   trait Specification extends Smockito:
  *      // Chain stubs to set up a mock instance.
  *      val repository = mock[Repository[User]]
  *         .on(it.exists)(args => mockUsers.map(_.username).contains(args._1))
  *         .on(() => it.get)(_ => mockUsers)
  *         .on(it.getWith) { case (start, end) =>

  *
  *      // Observe the past method interactions.

  *
  * All methods on [[Mock]] require an
  * [[https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/book/fun-eta-expansion.html eta-expanded method]] as the
  * first argument. The [[it]] shorthand is a terse way of capturing the mocked type in context.
  *
  * Method stubs are set up with [[Mock.on]]. Besides the method to mock, it requires a
  * [[PartialFunction]] to handle the expected inputs, represented as a well-typed tuple, with the
  * same shape as the mocked method arguments, that one may destructure.
  *
  * [[Mock.calls]] provides the captured arguments of all the past invocations of a stubbed method,
  * in chronological order, in the form of a tuple with the same shape as the method arguments, Ã  la
  * `scalamock`. If one only cares about the number of times a stub was called, [[Mock.times]] is
  * more efficient.
  *
  * Besides the obvious type safety differences at compile time, [[Smockito]] is more opinionated
  * than `Mockito` regarding the way one is allowed to set up mocks at runtime:
  *   - It will throw when a stub override is provided, discouraging a change of behaviour during
  *     the lifetime of a mock. The stub should be unique, predictable and handle all relevant cases
  *     upfront.
  *   - It will throw when `calls` or `times` is called on an unstubbed method.
  *
  * [[Mock]] is interoperable with all [[org.mockito.Mockito]] APIs.
